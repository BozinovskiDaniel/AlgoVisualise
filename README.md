# AlgorithmVisualiser

#### A web project that visualises various Path finding and Sorting Algorithms


#### Algorithms
##### Path Finding
- <b>Dijkstra's Algorithm</b>: Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph.
It differs from minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.<br>
- <b>Depth First Search (DFS)</b>: 
- <b>Breadth First Search (BFS)</b>:
- <b>A* Algorithm</b>: 

##### Sorting
- <b>Merge Sort</b>:
- <b>Quick Sort</b>:
- <b>Bubble Sort</b>:
- <b>Selection Sort</b>:
- <b>Insertion Sort</b>:


#### Project Technical Skills:

- React JS
- HTML
- CSS
