### Algorithms

##### Path Finding

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm" target="_blank"><b>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</b></a> Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph. It differs from minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.
  <br />
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" target="_blank"><b>Depth First Search (DFS):</b></a> An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at an arbitrary root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It does not guarantee the shortest path
  <br />
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank"><b>Breadth First Search (BFS):</b></a> An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at an arbitrary root node, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
  <br />
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" target="_blank"><b>A\* Algorithm:</b></a> A graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. A\* is still the best solution in many shortest path cases.
  <br />

##### Sorting

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort" target="_blank"><b>Merge Sort:</b></a> Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilises a technique of divide and conquer to sort
<br />

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank"><b>Quick Sort:</b></a> Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.
  <br />

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" target="_blank"><b>Bubble Sort:</b></a> Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
  <br />

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort" target="_blank"><b>Selection Sort:</b></a> Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n^2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
  <br />

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" target="_blank"><b>Insertion Sort:</b></a> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
